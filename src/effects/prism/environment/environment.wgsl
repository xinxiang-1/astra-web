// The deliberately sparse studio the prism reflects.
//
// It started as `glass-fractal`'s nine-panel baked cubemap, but this shot only
// needs three intentional surfaces: a dark back-left wall, a cool right key and
// a neutral strip below the prism. Defining them here keeps the environment editable
// in one WGSL file; `environment-bake.wgsl` rasterizes it once into the same 360° HDR
// texture layout used by the environment-map and transmission examples.
//
// The final line replays the round trip the asset used to perform — encode to
// gamma 2.2, decode as sRGB — so the values a reflection reads here are the values
// a reflection reads there, including the small mismatch between those two curves.
//
// The glass has no material roughness cone, but its pixel footprint can still
// select a prefiltered mip when a reflection compresses this map on screen.
