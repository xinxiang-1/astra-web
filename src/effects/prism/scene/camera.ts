/**
 * The one camera in the scene, and the wall it decides the size of.
 *
 * The wall is the picture: a frame that saw past a corner of it would end in a
 * hard edge against an empty room. Rather than pick a wall size and hope, this module runs
 * the relationship the other way — `wallCoverage` walks the frustum's corners to
 * the wall plane and `wallHalfHeight` returns the size that covers the worst of
 * them, over every position the pointer can put the camera in.
 * `geometry.test.ts` holds that at every aspect a canvas can take.
 *
 * The pointer only ever moves the view a few degrees off its resting angle. That
 * is deliberate: the deterministic ribbons live on a world-space sheet inside
 * the glass, so moving the camera only changes their projection — and a small
 * swing is enough to reveal their separation from the wall.

 * canvas: this returns the worst case over the pointer's whole swing, which is
 * exactly the size that guarantees the frame never sees past the lit wall.

 * and the continuous edge between them.
